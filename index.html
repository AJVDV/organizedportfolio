              <h3>What brought me to this field</h3>
              <p>Like many from my generation, and especially those after, a huge amount of my time is spent within the realms of digital interaction and consumption.
               It only makes sense that after having so much interest in web interactions, video games, and the digital age as a whole that I would become drawn to 
               software engineering and coding as a career. Finding that I have some natural talent, a good thought process for debugging, and creatively designing
               functional code, I have thus far thrived within the space. My passion for this creative process has only grown in the time I've spent with it, and is
               immensly rewarding for me.</p>
