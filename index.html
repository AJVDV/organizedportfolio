              <h3>What brought me to this field</h3>
              <p>Like many from my generation, and especially those after, a huge amount of my time is spent within the realms of digital interaction and consumption.
               It only makes sense that after having so much interest in web interactions, video games, and the digital age as a whole that I would become drawn to 
               software engineering and coding as a career. Finding that I have some natural talent, a good thought process for debugging, and creatively designing
               functional code, I have thus far thrived within the space. My passion for this creative process has only grown in the time I've spent with it, and is
               immensly rewarding for me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <h3>Where I am based</h3>
              <p>Originally I am from Scottsbluff, a small town in Western Nebraska, but I moved to Washington in 2019. I am located in Kent Washington. This is
                very near to Seattle, and as such is close enough for ample networking opportunities. I am happy to live and often work near such a metro area, and
                have found a great amount of opportunity because of it.</p>
            <div class="item">
              <h3>Team Oriented</h3>
              <p>
              Despite having pride in code I have created myself, and seeing my own functional work spring into existance, I am more than excited to collaborate with
               others to create truly impressive projects within the digital landscape. I find that group work can be even more rewarding, and often allows for much 
               larger projects to come to fruition. I can hardly wait to see what the future holds.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <h3>Who I am</h3>
              <p>
                Defining one's self is difficult, and only becomes more so when considering philosophy and existensialism, but I'd like to at least touch on who I am.
                 In a large sense I am a work in progress, as the vast majority of us are, but that isn't to say that I feel less than or inept, I simply strive to be
                 better than I was the day before, every day. I am a person who is quick to acknowledge my own mistakes and shortcomings, so that improvement can happen.
                 Having a small background in counseling psychology has helped me to realize that the pursuit of bettering one's self, and the world around them by
                 proxy is one of the best paths one can set themselves upon. I am a driven and detail oriented person. I enjoy music, video games, writing, and cooking.

              <h3>What I offer</h3>
              <p>
                Being that this is an assignment, and I am still quite new to a great deal of the field I will be listing what I hope to offer in the field rather than
                 my currently minimal skillset. I hope to offer a strong understading of coding, frontend, and serverside implementation, as well as a creative drive
                 for improving and maintianing existing projects. I hope to either solo, or with a team create progressive solutions to problems, and innovative 
                 improvements to current systems. As I continue to grow and improve within this skillset, I will add more, and give more detailed examples of what
                 I am capable of as well as what I can truly offer to potential employers/teammates.
